# Forza Motorsport Track Selector

Forza Motorsport's randomization is not good. It constantly repeats the same tracks, or only makes slight changes (ie. same track, slightly different time of day).

This tool re-rolls location. layout, time of day, and weather.
After a certain location / layout is used, it is added to a list of already used locations, and re-rolls for something new the next time that layout is encountered.
